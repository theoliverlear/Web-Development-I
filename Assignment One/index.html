      The ring I wear everyday is my wedding ring. I am engadged to my fiance,
      David, who I met at UWRF. For insurance reasons, we aren't married yet,
      but we were married from the first moment we met. I love him, he is my
      world, and best friend. I am so excited to spend the rest of my life
      with him. The ring I wear is a simple band with the engraving
      "<dfn title="a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts">
        Gestalt
      </dfn>"
      on the inside. It means "a whole that is greater than the sum of its
      parts". Click

      A painting which I will always hang on my wall is a painting of a an
      album cover from the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/theoliverlear"
         title="(New Tab) SoundCloud">music I made.</a>
      It was called "Hand-Me-Downs" and
      this painting reminds me of what everyone in my life did to help me
      through a difficult time. To not be specific, the trauma of my childhood
      made me very unwell. I was relentlessly bullied until I left my school
      junior year of high school. My one real friend, who I had known since I
      was 6, was the only person who would talk to me. I was so lonely and
      depressed. Over the course of these years, we would play tennis together
      and watch movies. He's an introvert and I'm an extrovert, so I knew that
      when said yes to hanging out, that it was a big deal. I was so grateful
      for him. So this painting by my sister, who is a shy painter but said
      yes to painting for me, reminds me of the people who were there for me
      when I needed them most.

      As a developer, something meaningful to me is my computer.
      I ended up being able to afford it after trading cryptocurrencies
      in early 2021. In summer of 2021, I fully assembled my computer — which
      had all the items I'd hoped for. It is a self-built computer and it was
      initially intended for editing audio as my current job was working as an
      audio engineer. I also used to to
      <a target="_blank"

      </a>.
      with the computer. I have since moved on to software development and I
      use it for that now. I am very proud of my computer and the things I can
      do with it. I'll never forget the

      </a>
      I completed with it. I was so excited to
        be learning something new and I'm so grateful and lucky that I had a
      computer to do it on. My computer is a manifestation of my personality
      where I can create and learn new things by myself — on my own accord.
