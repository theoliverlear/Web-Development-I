| Create a navigation menu or a set of links within your webpage that allows |
| users to navigate smoothly between different sections or items on the      |
| page. Use anchor tags (<a>) with appropriate href attributes to achieve    |
| this.                                                                      |

      The ring I am proud to wear everyday is my wedding ring. I am engadged
      to my fianc√©, David, who I met at UWRF. He is a psychology major and he
      works as a Behavioral Specialist at Rogers Behavioral Health in Woodbury
      , MN. He is the most kind and loving person I have ever met. He uses
      that love and kindness every day help kids, ages 13-18, deal with their
      depression,
      <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">
        OCD
      </abbr>
      , and trauma. For insurance reasons, we aren't married yet,
      but we were married at heart from the first moment we met. I love him,
      he is my world, and best friend. I am so excited to spend the rest of my
      life with him. The ring I wear is a simple band with the engraving
      "<dfn title="a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts">
        Gestalt
      </dfn>"
      on the inside. It means "a whole that is greater than the sum of its
      parts." I wear it proudly as a symbol of my love for David and the
      commitment I have made to him. Together, we are greater than the sum of
      us as individuals. Click

      A painting which I will always hang on my wall is a painting of a an
      album cover from the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/theoliverlear"
         title="(New Tab) SoundCloud">music I made.</a>
      It was called "Hand-Me-Downs" and
      this painting reminds me of what everyone in my life did to help me
      through a difficult time. To not be specific, the trauma of my childhood
      made me very unwell. I was relentlessly bullied my whole time in public
      school. It led me to leaving my school junior year of high school. My
      one real friend, who I had known since I was 6, was the only person I
      had to talk to. I was so lonely and depressed. Over the course of these
      years, we would play tennis together, watch movies, and talk. He's an
      introvert, and I'm an extrovert, so I knew that when said yes to hanging
      out, that it was a big deal. I was so grateful for him and others in my
      family who loved me as I was. So this painting by my sister, who is a
      shy painter but said yes to painting for me, reminds me of the people
      who were there for me when I needed them most.

      My library holds a special place in my heart. In September of 2022, when
      I started my programming journey, I was so excited to learn. Not knowing
      what resources were out there, I stumbled around websites, mostly forums
      like StackOverflow and found a lot of non-answers without any context.
      I learned this way, but it was difficult and slow. I was reminded of an
      old adage, "you get what you pay for." I decided to buy a book on Java
      and it was a game changer. I was able to learn so much more quickly!
      I had examples, context, and a clear, almost sequential path to follow.
      Since that point, I have bought many books on programming,
      cybersecurity, operating systems, and more. As I continue to learn, I
      gather more books in my library. You can scroll through them in the
      slideshow to the right. People often wonder how I learned so much so
      quickly since I started programming in September of 2022. I attest to
      them that I am not special, I just found the right resources. I am
      grateful for my library and the knowledge it has given me. I continue
      to look forward to learning more and I have my books to thank for my
      past, present, and future learning.

      As a developer, something meaningful to me is my computer.
      I ended up being able to afford it after trading cryptocurrencies
      in early 2021. I was particularly proud of myself for being able to
      afford it because I had been only been able to use weak laptops or
      cheap desktops for my entire life. I had always wanted a powerful
      computer and I finally had the means to get one from working hard and
      making smart trades. In summer of 2021, I fully assembled my computer ‚Äî
      which had all the items I'd hoped for. It is a self-built computer and
      it was initially intended for editing audio as my current job was
      working as an audio engineer. I also used to to
      <a target="_blank"
         href="https://soundcloud.com/theoliverlear"
         title="(New Tab) SoundCloud">produce my own music
      </a>
      with the computer. I have since moved on to software development and I
      use it for that now. I am very proud of my computer and the things I can
      do with it. I'll never forget the

      I completed with it. I was so excited to be learning something new and
      I'm so grateful and lucky that I had a computer to do it on. My computer
      is a manifestation of my personality where I can create and learn new
      things by myself ‚Äî on my own accord.

      In August 2022, I was hacked. As a freelance audio engineer, I came 
      across a file that ended up being malicious. It started with my computer
      being hacked and spread to any other device I had on my network. 
      Accounts associated with me were hacked. I was devastated and felt
      powerless ‚Äî nothing prepared me for this. Only those who have been
      hacked know how scary it is. Bank accounts, social media, private
      messages, and more were all exposed. My phone calls would be redirected,
      my texts would be read, and my computer I worked so hard to afford was
      now a tool for the hacker ‚Äî mostly to mine cryptocurrency. I was scared
      and it took me awhile to accept the fact that I could not solve it with
      half-measures. After months, I had to wipe my computer, phone, laptop,
      anything that was connected to my initial infiltration. This was
      particularly difficult because I had to wipe my computer which held all
      my music projects. I had to wipe, what where my dreams, into nothing. 
      This was a very difficult time and realizing time for me. I learned a
      lot about the technology field. It, along with the devastation of my 
      music library, that was the catalyst for me to switch my life path from
      music to technology.

      I am grateful for the experience and I am grateful
      for the lessons I learned. The items shown are the pieces of technology
      which gave me my life back after a months' long battle with the hacker.
      The first is a

         target="_blank" title="(New Tab) YubiKey">

      which is a hardware security key. It's a physical key that I can use to
      authenticate my accounts. It's the most secure way to protect myself
      because only the key holder can access the account. The second item is
      my heavy-duty router. This router is an absolute beast and it is the
      most secure router I could find. It has a built-in firewall, VPN, and it
      is very difficult to hack. It sustained at least a half dozen DDOS
      attacks and I believe after handling each one, the hacker gave up.
      Though costly, it was worth it and I am very grateful for the freedom it
      has given me. These items are a daily reminder of one of the most
      important events of my life and how responding to situations with
      full-measures can be painful, but a necessary pain to solve a problem.
