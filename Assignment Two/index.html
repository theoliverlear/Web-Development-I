            I have a series of certifications from taking Codecademy courses –
            an educational programming platform. Such certifications include
            Java, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – among others. The
            work done to get these certifications has made me adept enough to
            build the proceeding projects. In conjunction to Codecademy
            courses, I actively pursue independent learning and projects.
            Learning a diverse selection of topics has been beneficial to make
            programs that interact with each other. While still being a humble
            learner, I have been adept at my main language Java where you will
            see I have been able to progress to having skills in database
            management, graphical user interfaces, and logic-intensive
            algorithms. I continue to learn and add more certifications.

            The Crypto Trader is a Java program which tracks the price of
            cryptocurrencies and trades them in a profitable way. The
            algorithm for which the program is based on is not an attempt to
            project the cryptocurrency market – but to follow the adage “buy
            low, sell high.” Taking such an approach is a solely profitable
            endeavor. While trying to game the market may earn someone more
            than the Crypto Trader, the program leverages computing power to
            earn secure money. Risk is a factor for many traders. Providing an
            automated way to perform trades which guarantees a safe bet will
            open up the market to people who are afraid to put their precious
            capital into a volatile market. Once fully implemented, users from
            Coinbase to Binance could run the program to perform profitable
            trades with a speed and attentiveness that only a computer can
            have.

            The Crypto Trader Analysis program is a utility used alongside the
            Crypto Trader to provide the user with an analysis of
            cryptocurrency value and insight into the profitability of the
            trading algorithm. The program is built upon Python’s vast data
            science libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. While Crypto Trader
            is the brains, Crypto Trader Analysis is the beauty. That beauty
            is the conversion of textual or spreadsheet data into a
            human-readable form using visualizations. Such visualizations are
            the value of a given cryptocurrency over time, the way that has
            affected one’s portfolio by the trading algorithm, and an
            evaluation of the best performing assets. Moving forward, the
            Crypto Trader Analysis program will add more algorithms and
            visualizations to its library. Items like scatter plot
            relationships upon different data points will assist in making
            decisions about which currency is most profitable in a correlative
            manner. Along with static visualizations, the program aims to have
            animated data which will provide another dimension of analysis for
            the user.

            A product of the UWRF Development Team, the Currency Converter,
            which I contributed to, provides a simple yet important service.
            It provides the user with an immediate evaluation of a currency’s
            value. Many people who search for tools do not want them to be
            overly complex. Often the best tools are reserved and provide a
            service in an intuitive and swift manner. The program takes data
            from Open Exchange Rates API. This API provides an almost instant
            evaluation of currency values. It solidifies the Currency
            Converter with an authoritative and swift dataset. From US Dollars
            to Pesos to Rubles, the Currency Converter will operate with any
            combination of currency conversion. The user may also operate the
            program as a wallet to keep up to date their assets in various
            currencies as an investment endeavor. For example, a user may want
            an up-to-date conversion of Rubles to US Dollars based on the oil
            productivity of the Russian state. Or, perhaps, the United States
            Federal Reserve increases interest rates. The user will be able to
            decide if the value of their currency is best held in US Dollars
            or a more stable currency. These are some of many scenarios where
            the Currency Converter can be utilized. The program will continue
            to evolve and will provide its service in both a desktop and web
            medium. In web form, a user could simply type into Google
            “currency converter” and be provided with instant service or in
            desktop form where the program may be a data source for other
            applications who rely on currency values and exchanges for
            operation.

        <h2 class="section-header">Insulin Pump</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            As a Type 1 Diabetic, one of my first programming endeavors was
            the creation of an insulin pump program. The Insulin Pump program
            performs calculations for the user to easily log and manage their
            blood sugars. From the delivery screen, one may input their
            current blood sugar and how many carbs they plan to eat. With the
            data, the program will provide the user with an accurate bolus.
            The Insulin Pump program is in tandem with the technological
            efforts of CareLink. The program will hold, visualize, and
            calculate Diabetes related data. Taking the right bolus is vital
            to a Diabetics health. Accounting for such importance, the program
            currently has a stable and safe set of algorithms, which will
            conduct calculations for the user, as its first priority. There
            will be no need to grab a calculator to see how many times a
            12-carb serving goes into 57 carbs and how many units of a
            correction go into a blood sugar of 267. The Insulin Pump utilizes
            the computer’s ability to make complex calculations quickly to
            provide an enhanced way of life for Diabetics who use its tools.
            Future functionality of the Insulin Pump program will be a
            connection between one’s sensor via Bluetooth and the Insulin Pump
            program. Someone will be able to press a button to see the trends
            of their blood sugars and its relation to basal and carb ratios or
            calculate a bolus with a few strokes of a keyboard. The Insulin
            Pump takes the mission of CareLink and runs with it to provide a
            program for Diabetics by Diabetics.
