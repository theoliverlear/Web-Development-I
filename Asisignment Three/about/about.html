            <p>
                My name is Oliver Sigwarth and I was born in River Falls,
                Wisconsin on August 16th, 2000. My parents are glassblowing
                artists. Their business is Sigwarth Glass. They are extremely
                accomplished in their field. They have installations in
                various museums, hospitals, and elsewhere.  They have received
                numerous awards for their work. I have a sister Eva, who has
                a master’s degree in psychology. She is currently working as a
                case manager for Peirce County and she is on track to become a
                full-time therapist. My partner David has a degree in
                psychology from the University of Wisconsin – River Falls,
                which is the place we met. He works at Roger’s Behavioral
                Health in Woodbury, Minnesota. He works in depression recovery
                where he assists children ages eleven to eighteen in repairing
                their mental health. I have a very successful family and I
                find myself in very lucky and loving company. I originally
                went to the University of Wisconsin – River Falls for music. I
                went to school for many years pursuing music and during that
                time put out three albums of music. One of my songs “Walking”
                is the theme to the Independent Artists’ Podcast. After
                experiencing major life events like being hacked and having my
                information exposed, I found myself oriented to a new field of
                inquiry. Learning about the tech world made me change my focus
                from music to computer science. I am now pursuing a degree in
                computer science. I work very hard with my various hobbies to
                pursue a successful life and career by building skills and
                learning.
